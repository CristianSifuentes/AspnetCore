## Key Features

1. **Cross-Platform**:  
   - Runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
2. **Unified Framework**:  
   - Combines ASP.NET MVC, Web API, and Web Pages into a single programming model.
3. **High Performance**:  
   - Optimized for performance-critical applications using the Kestrel web server.
4. **Modern UI Development**:  
   - Supports **Razor Pages**, **Blazor**, and **MVC** for UI-driven development.
5. **Dependency Injection**:  
   - Built-in support for dependency injection throughout the framework.
6. **Minimal APIs**:  
   - Lightweight API creation with minimal setup.
7. **Real-Time Communication**:  
   - Integrates **SignalR** for WebSocket-based real-time communication.
8. **Integration with Modern Tools**:  
   - Works with Docker, Kubernetes, and CI/CD pipelines.
9. **Open Source**:  
   - Developed in collaboration with the community on GitHub.

## How ASP.NET Core Works

1. **Middleware Pipeline**:  
   - Requests are processed through a customizable pipeline of middleware components.
2. **Routing**:  
   - Supports endpoint routing for clean and efficient URL handling.
3. **Dependency Injection**:  
   - Services are registered and injected into controllers, Razor Pages, or APIs.
4. **Hosting**:  
   - Runs on the Kestrel server or integrates with IIS for hosting.
5. **Razor Pages and Blazor**:  
   - Razor Pages simplify page-focused development, while Blazor enables interactive web UIs using C# instead of JavaScript.

---

## Supported Platforms

- **Languages**: C#, F#.
- **Operating Systems**: Windows, macOS, Linux.
- **Development Models**: MVC, Razor Pages, Blazor (Server/WebAssembly), APIs.

## Impact and Challenges

### **Impact**

1. **Modern Development**:  
   - Encourages modular, scalable, and secure development practices.
   
2. **Cross-Platform Flexibility**:  
   - Supports developers targeting multiple platforms with the same codebase.

3. **Community-Driven**:  
   - Open-source contributions lead to rapid innovation and improvements.

### **Challenges**

1. **Migration Complexity**:  
   - Legacy applications require significant rework to transition from ASP.NET to ASP.NET Core.
   
2. **Learning Curve**:  
   - Adopting modern paradigms like dependency injection and middleware requires training.
